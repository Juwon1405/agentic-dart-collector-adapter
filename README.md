## Architecture

![architecture](docs/img/arch.png)

The adapter installs **once** on the analysis server. It is **not** installed on incident hosts. Each incident host receives a Velociraptor agent binary for its OS / arch (Windows / Linux / macOS), runs it once to produce `evidence.zip`, and ships the ZIP back. The adapter then performs the layout translation that Agentic-DART expects.

---

## Position in the Agentic-DART roadmap

This repository is **Phase 1.3** of the [Agentic-DART rollout roadmap](https://github.com/Juwon1405/agentic-dart#phase-1-rollout-roadmap) — the *collector adapter* deliverable. It exists so the upstream collection layer (Velociraptor) and the upstream analysis engine (Agentic-DART) can stay independent of each other.

| Concern                  | Where it lives                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Collection** on hosts  | [Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/) agent (binary, runs on the endpoint)                                  |
| **Layout normalization** | **This repo** *(Phase 1.3, current)*                                                                                 |
| **Analysis & reasoning** | [Agentic-DART](https://github.com/Juwon1405/agentic-dart) (runs on the same analysis server)                         |
| **Chain-of-custody**     | This adapter seeds it (`manifest.json` + SHA-256 index); Agentic-DART continues it as `audit.jsonl` entry 1 onwards. |

---

## Why this exists

[Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/) is an excellent open-source IR collector with cross-platform agents (Windows / Linux / macOS) and a huge artifact library (`Windows.KapeFiles.Targets`, `Windows.Forensics.Lnkfiles`, `MacOS.Forensics.*`, `Linux.Forensics.*`).

[Agentic-DART](https://github.com/Juwon1405/agentic-dart) is an autonomous DFIR analysis engine that consumes a flat, well-named `evidence_root/` directory:

```
evidence_root/
├── manifest.json
├── Prefetch/         SVCHOST.EXE-XYZ.pf, ...
├── Amcache/          Amcache.hve
├── Registry/         SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, SAM, ...
├── EventLogs/        Security.evtx, ...
├── Browser/          History, places.sqlite, ...
├── WebLogs/          access.log, u_ex240509.log, ...
├── AuthLogs/         auth.log, secure
├── Memory/           memory.dmp
├── LNK/              *.lnk
├── JumpLists/        *.automaticDestinations-ms
├── MFT/              $MFT
├── USNJournal/       $UsnJrnl-$J
├── PowerShell/       ConsoleHost_history.txt
└── Other/            (anything unrecognized)
```

Velociraptor's offline-collector ZIPs do **not** look like that. Members are paths like `uploads/auto/C:/Windows/System32/winevt/Logs/Security.evtx`, mixed with `results/*.json` and per-artifact subtrees.

This adapter is the **glue**:

```
Velociraptor offline ZIP  ─▶  dart-collector-adapter  ─▶  evidence_root/
                                                          (Agentic-DART reads this)
```

It is stdlib-only by design (no third-party Python packages), and small enough to audit in one sitting.

### Positioning vs. commercial EDR collection (Falcon Forensics, Tanium)

This adapter **complements — does not compete with** — commercial
EDR-based ad-hoc collection (CrowdStrike Falcon Forensics, Tanium
Threat Response, etc.).

Commercial agent-based collection covers the **80% case**: hosts that
already run the vendor agent, where the IR team can push a collection
job from the central console and pull a curated artefact bundle back
in minutes. That is the right tool for that scenario.

This adapter covers the remaining **20%** — the cases that determine
how bad an incident gets:

- **No agent installed.** Third-party / partner / contractor endpoints,
  BYOD devices, legacy servers, isolated lab networks, build systems.
- **Agent installed but ineffective.** Compromised hosts where the
  attacker disabled or tampered with the EDR agent before triage.
- **Raw disk image acquisitions.** DD / E01 / AFF / VMDK images
  handed over by a client or seized for analysis — the host is gone,
  the image is all there is.
- **Emergency triage.** Need to acquire from an unmanaged host in
  the next thirty minutes, no time to deploy and license an agent.
- **Sensitive cases.** Investigations where pushing a job through the
  central commercial console is itself a leak risk.

Velociraptor's offline collector is a **single binary, no install, no
network call**. Drop it on a USB, run it, get the ZIP, hand it to this
adapter, and Agentic-DART sees the same `evidence_root` layout it sees
from any other source.

Agentic-DART intentionally consumes **both** channels through the same
`evidence_root` contract. The analysis engine does not care which
collector produced the data, and the organization is not coupled to a
single commercial vendor's collection format.

---

## Install

The analysis server runs on Linux or macOS. There are two install scripts,
for two different jobs:

**`scripts/install.sh`** — set up the adapter on *this* analyst machine.
Installs the Python adapter (`dart-collector-adapter`) and downloads the one
Velociraptor binary that matches the current host's OS/arch, verifying it
against the upstream `sha256sums` manifest.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Juwon1405/agentic-dart-collector-adapter
cd agentic-dart-collector-adapter
bash scripts/install.sh
```

Pin a specific Velociraptor version, choose an install dir, or skip the
binary entirely:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --version 0.74.0
bash scripts/install.sh --install-dir /opt/dart/bin
bash scripts/install.sh --no-velociraptor      # adapter only
```

**`scripts/fetch-responder-binaries.sh`** — stage Velociraptor binaries for
*every* common OS/arch into `./bin/velociraptor/`, so responders can ship the
right binary to any Windows/Linux/macOS incident host without leaving the
analysis server. Run this only when you need the multi-platform set.

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-responder-binaries.sh
VELO_VERSION=0.74.0 bash scripts/fetch-responder-binaries.sh   # pin version
bash scripts/fetch-responder-binaries.sh --no-velociraptor     # adapter only
```

Manual install of just the adapter (no Velociraptor at all):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### 1. On the incident host — collect

Ship the matching Velociraptor binary to the host:

```bash
# from the analysis server
scp ./bin/velociraptor/velociraptor-windows-amd64 \
    responder@incident-host:C:/temp/velociraptor.exe
```

Run an offline collector on the host (one-time execution, no agent install):

```cmd
:: on Windows incident host
C:\temp\velociraptor.exe -i artifacts collect Windows.KapeFiles.Targets ^
    --output C:\temp\evidence.zip
```

```bash
# on Linux / macOS incident host
./velociraptor -i artifacts collect Linux.Search.FileFinder \
    --output /tmp/evidence.zip
```

Copy `evidence.zip` back to the analysis server.

### 2. On the analysis server — adapt

```bash
dart-collector-adapter \
    --input /tmp/evidence.zip \
    --output /evidence/case-2026-001/ \
    --case-id case-2026-001
```

Output:

```json
{
  "bytes_copied": 12483920,
  "case_id": "case-2026-001",
  "categories": {
    "amcache": 1,
    "browser": 4,
    "eventlog": 7,
    "prefetch": 156,
    "registry": 6
  },
  "files_copied": 174,
  "files_skipped": 0,
  "output_root": "/evidence/case-2026-001"
}
```

### 3. Hand off to Agentic-DART

```bash
python -m dart_agent run \
    --evidence /evidence/case-2026-001/ \
    --playbook senior-analyst-v3.yaml
```

Agentic-DART picks up the `evidence_root` layout, reads `manifest.json` as the chain-of-custody seed, and writes its own `audit.jsonl` to continue the chain.

---

## Programmatic API

```python
from dart_collector_adapter import adapt

result = adapt(
    velociraptor_zip="/tmp/evidence.zip",
    output_evidence_root="/evidence/case-2026-001/",
    case_id="case-2026-001",
)

print(result.files_copied, result.bytes_copied, result.categories)
```

Returns an `AdapterResult` dataclass:

```python
@dataclass
class AdapterResult:
    output_root: Path
    case_id: str
    files_copied: int
    files_skipped: int
    bytes_copied: int
    categories: dict[str, int]
    skipped_paths: list[str]
```

## What the adapter actually does

| Step | What                                                                                                  |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Open the Velociraptor ZIP and iterate every file member.                                              |
| 2    | Classify each member by name (`.pf` → Prefetch, `Amcache.hve` → Amcache, `*.evtx` → EventLogs, ...).  |
| 3    | Validate the basename — reject control bytes, traversal characters, and anything that resolves outside the evidence_root. |
| 4    | Stream-copy into `evidence_root/<Category>/<basename>` (preserves binary content, never modifies).    |
| 5    | After all files copied, walk the output and SHA-256 every file (1 MiB streaming, no full-file load).  |
| 6    | Write `manifest.json` last so a half-finished run never looks successful.                             |

### Refused inputs

The adapter is opinionated about what it *won't* do, to keep its security surface tiny:

- Files larger than 10 GiB are skipped (`max_bytes_per_file`, configurable).
- Cumulative extracted bytes are capped at 50 GiB (`max_total_bytes`, configurable) to defend against many-small-files zip-bomb shapes.
- The per-file cap is enforced against bytes *actually read* — the ZIP header's `file_size` is treated as untrusted.
- ZIP members whose POSIX mode marks them as symbolic links are skipped.
- ZIP members with control characters in the name are skipped.
- ZIP members whose path would resolve outside `evidence_root` are skipped.
- Existing `evidence_root` with a manifest is not overwritten (use `--overwrite`; when used, known layout subdirectories are cleared first so stale evidence cannot contaminate the new manifest).

Skipped paths are reported in `AdapterResult.skipped_paths` **and** persisted under `skipped` in `manifest.json` for chain-of-custody.

## Why not just fork Velociraptor?

Because forking 100k+ lines of Go to add one Python adapter would be insane.

- Velociraptor releases patches every few weeks. Tracking those in a fork is a full-time job.
- Adapter design = ~500 LOC of Python. Fork design = thousands of LOC of Go you don't own.
- This way, responders use **upstream Velociraptor releases** and pin the version via `VELO_VERSION` (or `--version`) in the install scripts. Security patches arrive on day zero.

## Phase roadmap

![roadmap](docs/img/roadmap.png)

| Phase     | Status   | Scope                                                                                            |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **v1.0**  | current  | Velociraptor ZIP → evidence_root with SHA-256 manifest 1.1; hardened integrity (input-ZIP SHA-256 anchor, persisted skip log, overwrite-safe), ZIP-bomb + symlink defenses, single-pass hashing, mtime preservation, install-time binary checksum verification. Full test suite passing on Linux+macOS × py3.10/11/12. |
| **v1.1**  | next     | Sidecar generation — auto-invoke `PECmd`, `AmcacheParser`, `EvtxECmd` when present locally.       |
| **v1.2**  | later    | Ingest Velociraptor `results/*.json` (parsed-artifact JSON) and merge into the manifest.          |
| **v1.3**  | later    | macOS + Linux artifact coverage parity with Windows.                                              |

The adapter is intentionally narrow. It will not grow into a "platform."
